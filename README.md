## Julia Silva - Portfolio

ðŸ‘‰ https://www.juliasilvadeveloper.com/

Welcome to my frontend developer portfolio. In this repository, you'll find a showcase of my projects and contributions as a frontend developer. Below, I'll provide you with an overview of the technologies I use, the structure of this repository, and how to navigate through it.

## Technologies Used:

-   Next.js: I leverage Next.js for building React applications with server-side rendering, routing, and other powerful features. Next.js provides a seamless development experience and allows me to build performant and scalable web applications.

-   Tailwind CSS: I utilize Tailwind CSS for rapidly building custom user interfaces. Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that enables me to design responsive and modern UI components with ease.
